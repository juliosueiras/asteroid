Extreme Asteroid
================

For our project, we plan to expand on our previous midterm and turn it into a asteroid-based game.Meaning instead of a top-down game, now enemies come from all-directions. 

The player will be able to rotate 360$^{\circ}$ degrees, and move in all-directions.

Optional
========

We also(provided with enough time) want to implement a more realistic physics system
